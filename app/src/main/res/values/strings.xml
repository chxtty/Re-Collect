    <string name="foggy_morning" >I woke up this morning to the sound of birds. I think they were robins. Or maybe finches. Either way, they were cheerful, and I liked that.
I made tea. At least I think I did. The cup was warm in my hands, and it smelled like jasmine. Or maybe it was earl grey. I used to drink earl grey with someone. A woman. She had soft hands and laughed like wind chimes. I can’t remember her name. Isn’t that something?
A young man came by. He called me Grandpa and kissed my forehead. I wish I knew his name. He has kind eyes, though. Maybe he’s mine. Maybe he’s just being sweet.
The nurse — Clara? Carla? — helped me find my slippers. I lose them often. They like to play hide and seek, I think.
Sometimes I get scared when I can’t remember things. But other times, like now, I just sit in the sun and let it warm my skin. That feels real. That feels enough.
